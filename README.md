# Data for public health action
Hi! I'm Laurel. I'm an epidemiologist. I'm really interested in working on some of the big problems in public health: methods for wrangling large data systems, implementing reproducible research and data system interoperabililty. 

This website details my forays into collaborative and solo projects as I learn R.
